# ParadoxaDirecta

This app was designed to replace the Paradox Launcher recently added in Cities: Skylines.

## Features

- Automatically start the game instead of having to hit another play button
- No data collection, no ads, no advertisements, no constant communications with remote servers
- Option to automatically load last save game
- Option to use Direct3D 9 instead of DirectX 11 (useful if you have problems)
- Option to use Open GL instead of DirectX 11 (useful if you have problems)
- Option to limit FPS
- Option to disable game log files (increases load speed but errors can't be easily identified if they occur)
- Option to disable Steam Workshop and/or mods
- Option to specify any other launch options you might need

## Installation
